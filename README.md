Hi there! This is a front end project working with the NC News API I set up during my NC News back end project. The API can be found here:

https://lizzie-hughes-nc-news-project.onrender.com/api

Feel free to browse my code! If you want to see the app running use the command "npm run dev" after running "npm install" in the terminal.

(The website deliberately looks that ugly with the colour scheme, it is encapsulating some BBC NewsRound nostalgia!)

"grumpy19" is one of the users from my API, it is the default user until you go to the "Sign in" button and change your user. This will then change the greetings in the header and the navigation bar too.

Hi there! This is a front end project working with the NC News API I set up during my NC News back end project. The API can be found here:

https://lizzie-hughes-nc-news-project.onrender.com/api

Feel free to browse my code! If you want to see the app running use the command "npm run dev" after running "npm install" in the terminal.
